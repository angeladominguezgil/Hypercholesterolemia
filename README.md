# **ABSTRACT**

Hypercholesterolemia is a prevalent lipid disorder characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which has been demonstrated to significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic form of the condition, affects approximately 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 individuals in Europe and is often underdiagnosed, leading to premature cardiovascular events. Despite the widespread use of statins and other lipid-lowering therapies, many patients, especially those with genetic predisposition, fail to achieve optimal control of their lipid levels in plasma. This underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. 

The development of a novel drug is a complex, costly and time-consuming process that often requires over a decade. In this context, this thesis explores the application of Chemoinformatic and Machine Learning tools to streamline and accelerate drug discovery for hypercholesterolemia-related diseases. By exploring high throughput biological and chemical data and the implementation of the IFPTML (Information Fusion + Perturbation Theory + Machine Learning) methodology, different algorithms will be performed to predict the biological activity of candidate molecules. This approach integrates structural descriptors, experimental assays conditions and perturbation-based variables to train predictive models capable of identifying compounds early in the discovery pipeline. The use of an open-source software as Python and the adherence to FAIR/O principles further ensures transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative potential in data-driven pharmaceutical research.
